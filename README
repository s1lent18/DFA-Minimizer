The C++ File contains the code for DFA(Deterministic Finite Automata) minimization using Partition theorem

You Will have to provide:
- number of states
- number of alphabets 
- number of final states
- final states

The states start from q0
After providing the inputs, the transition table will be generated for the minimized dfa
